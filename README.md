## Docker

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside lightweight, portable containers.

Why it works well in this trio:

- Isolation: Docker containers encapsulate everything an application needs to run (code, runtime, system tools, libraries) ensuring consistency across development, staging, and production environments.
- Microservices: It facilitates a microservices architecture where each service (e.g., web server, database) can run in its container, enhancing scalability and reliability.
- DevOps: Integrates smoothly with DevOps workflows, supporting continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), making updates and scaling more manageable.

## React

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for web applications.

Why it works well in this trio:

- Component-Based Architecture: Encourages building UIs in encapsulated components that manage their state, leading to more manageable and reusable code.
- Performance: Implements a virtual DOM to minimize costly DOM manipulations, enhancing performance especially in dynamic applications.
- Ecosystem: Benefits from a vast ecosystem and strong community support, providing a wealth of libraries and tools that can be integrated easily within a Dockerized environment.

## PostgreSQL


PostgreSQL is an advanced, open-source relational database system known for its robustness, performance, and standards compliance.

Why it works well in this trio:

- Advanced Features: Supports a mix of traditional SQL (relational) alongside non-relational queries (JSON), making it versatile for a wide range of applications.
- Scalability and Reliability: Excel in handling large volumes of data and complex queries, essential for modern web applications that require dynamic content generation.
- Docker Compatibility: Can be containerized within Docker, simplifying development, testing, and deployment processes. Ensures consistency across all environments.


## Together as a Framework


When used together, Docker, React, and PostgreSQL offer a comprehensive set of tools that address the development, UI, and data management aspects of web applications.

- Docker acts as the spine, providing a consistent environment for development, testing, and deployment, mitigating the "it works on my machine" syndrome.
- React serves as the face, enabling developers to build dynamic, high-performance user interfaces that enhance user experience.
- PostgreSQL acts as the heart, offering robust, reliable data storage and retrieval mechanisms that can scale with the application's growth.


This combination supports rapid, flexible, and scalable web application development, from conceptualization to deployment, making it a popular choice among developers and organizations.


By leveraging these technologies together, developers can enjoy a streamlined workflow that promotes efficiency, consistency, and quality in building modern web applications.


### The plan

- Setup a basic django application running in docker. Commit the changes.
- Setup Django using React serving the front end
- Start the Development.

There are a few tasks that need to get out the way.

local developemnt env and production.

Almost the same

For React prosuction a the built source will be served by Django
